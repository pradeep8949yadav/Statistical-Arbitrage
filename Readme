##  Overview  

**Statistical Arbitrage** is a quantitative trading strategy that identifies mispricings between related assets.  
This project implements a **cointegration-based mean reversion model** using **Amazon (AMZN)** and **Google (GOOG)** stock data to detect long-term relationships and exploit short-term deviations for profitable opportunities.  

---

### ⚙️ **Methodology**  

#### 1️⃣ **Data Collection**  
- Historical daily price data for **AMZN** and **GOOG** were fetched using `yfinance`.  
- Data was preprocessed, cleaned, and aligned for identical time windows.  

#### 2️⃣ **Cointegration Testing (Engle–Granger Two-Step Method)**  
- **Step 1:** Regression of AMZN on GOOG to estimate hedge ratio (β).  
- **Step 2:** Apply Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on residuals to confirm stationarity.  
- **Result:** p-value = **0.0297** → Reject null hypothesis → Series are cointegrated.  

#### 3️⃣ **Signal Generation**  
- Compute the **spread**:  
  \[
  \text{Spread}_t = \text{AMZN}_t - β \times \text{GOOG}_t
  \]  
- Compute rolling **mean (μ)** and **standard deviation (σ)**.  
- Define **Z-score**:  
  \[
  Z_t = \frac{\text{Spread}_t - μ_t}{σ_t}
  \]  

**Trading Logic:**  
- **Go Long** when Z < -1  
- **Go Short** when Z > +1  
- **Exit** when |Z| < 0.25  

#### 4️ **Backtesting**  
- Implemented rolling-window backtesting to ensure realistic strategy evaluation.  
- Assessed **cumulative returns**, **Sharpe ratio**, and **win rate**.  
- Conducted **regime stability analysis** across market phases.  

---

## Results  

- Strong long-term equilibrium between AMZN and GOOG.  
- Cointegration confirmed with **p = 0.0297**.  
- Optimal hedge ratio: **β = 1.6161**.  
- Stable returns achieved via mean reversion during backtesting.

## Tech Stack  

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`, `scipy`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
